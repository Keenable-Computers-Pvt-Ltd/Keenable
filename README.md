# Keenable
## Overview
* Keen & Able Computers Pvt Ltd was established in 1996 as Open Source movement was just beginning to take shape.

* We believe in the power of Open Source.  Like the communities working around Open Source in a collaborative manner, we have been working with our customers to provide solutions they can depend on.
* We are in the business of solving customer problems in the areas of trainings, project implementation and product development. Together, along with our pool of sister organisations, we have the capability to address requirements in the area of RDBMS, No SQL DB, Big Data, Cloud, Automation, IoT, Middleware, Integration, DevOps, Management and Machine Learning.

* Since the beginning, we have believed that Open Source can be a success only with the right level of skilling. To this end, we have advanced training facilities to provide training  to individuals or corporate wishing to get trained on such technologies. 

* We make it a point to have trainers who are consultants and consultants who are trainers to bring in best practices in books and real life scenarios together for sustained growth.

* As someone said "Goodness is its own reward"​, we take pride that we are able to practise what we believe – being Open and working towards the benefit of one's customers is the key to growth and success.

* We have been practising Corporate Social Responsibility even before it became a buzzword. We feel happy in the success of many developers and trainers in our fold who started with us as non-engineers and even office boys in some cases!!  We do not think we could have been able to achieve this had we not adopted Open Source learning to the fullest.

* Come and experience the charm of Open Source with us. We would be happy to collaborate with you and help reach the right training levels as well as collaborative project deployment. 

* Yes, We have always been Open!
